        <p>The Data/Interactivity 10-week portion of this course introduces students to the essential concepts, tools, and story forms in multimedia storytelling. Students learn the basics of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, leverage existing frameworks and libraries (Bootstrap, jQuery), and pitch, report, produce, and critique interactive, media-rich news packages.</p>

        <p>The course covers four common multimedia story forms (slideshows, charts, maps, and quizzes), which allow students to explore the different narrative potential of each, and to delve into data, coding, design, and interactivity. This module covers fundamental technical skills that will serve as the foundation for your interactive work at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.</p>

        <p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

        <pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
        $ git fetch origin
        $ git checkout gh-pages
        </code></pre>

        <p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

        <h4>Grading</h4>
        <p>Your grade in this 10-week portion of the course is determined by two factors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Participation (20%)</li>
          <li>Successful completion of four multimedia stories (80% total, 20% each)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your participation includes attending all classes and being punctual, being active in discussions, workshops and critiques, and participating in all in-class hands-on activities.</p>
        <p>Grades for your multimedia stories are further broken down as follows: Pitch (20%), Final (80%). You are required to pitch, report, and produce a story for each of the forms. Your course grade depends on successfully meeting the requirements for each story and meeting all deadlines each step of the way.</p>
        
        
        
         A complete pitch should tell us who cares, why we care now, and what pre-reporting youâ€™ve done. You must include:
        a proposed title or headline
        a news hook, or explanation of why this story matters now. Why should I care?
        your nut that captures the essence of the story. 1-2 sentences only.
        a description of and link your potential source(s), whether a database, character, or expert contact.
