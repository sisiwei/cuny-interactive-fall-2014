        <p>The Data/Interactivity 10-week portion of this course introduces students to the essential concepts, tools, and story forms in multimedia storytelling. Students learn the basics of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, leverage existing frameworks and libraries (Bootstrap, jQuery), and pitch, report, produce, and critique interactive, media-rich news packages.</p>

        <p>The course covers four common multimedia story forms (slideshows, charts, maps, and quizzes), which allow students to explore the different narrative potential of each, and to delve into data, coding, design, and interactivity. This module covers fundamental technical skills that will serve as the foundation for your interactive work at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.</p>

        <h4>Syllabus Outline</h4>
        <div class="image"><img src="images/syllabus.png"></div>

        <h4>Grading</h4>
        <p>Your grade in this 10-week portion of the course is determined by two factors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Participation (20%)</li>
          <li>Successful, on-time completion of four interactive stories (80% total, 20% each)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Participation includes attending all classes and being punctual, being active in discussions of the reading material, workshops and critiques, and participating in all in-class activities.</p>
        <p>Grades for your interactive stories are broken down as: Pitch (20%), Final (80%). You are required to pitch, report, and produce a story for each of the forms. Your course grade depends on successfully meeting the requirements for each story and meeting all deadlines.</p>
        <p><strong>Late Penalty</strong>: Assignments that are turned in late will be deduced one full letter grade per day. Ex: an assignment turned in one day late earns an A, but is reduced to a B.</p>

        <h4 id="pitching">Pitching</h4>
        <p>A complete pitch should tell us who cares, why we care now, and what pre-reporting you’ve done. You must include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A proposed headline</li>
          <li>Why a reader should care (a news hook or explanation of why the story matters now)</li>
          <li>Nut graf capturing the essence of the story (1-2 sentences)</li>
          <li>Description and link to potential sources (database, character, or expert contact)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Story Requirements</h4>
        <p>Remember: Headlines and captions are part of your story. Work is not complete without them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Slideshow</strong> <br/>Your slideshow should include six to ten different images with captions and a headline. Each caption should be 20 to 100 words.</li>
          <li><strong>Chart</strong> <br/>You will create two charts that use data with news interest. The charts must include a headline and caption that direct readers to a clear takeaway. Your caption should be between 50 and 150 words.</li>
          <li><strong>Map</strong> <br/>Your map can be a map of points or shapes, but should include a clear, thoughtful title and a caption. Your caption should be between 50 and 150 words.</li>
          <li><strong>Quiz</strong> <br/>Your quiz should include four to six questions with two to four possible answers each that provide explanatory feedback for both incorrect and correct answers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your work for this class should be your own original reporting. However, if you've done reporting for another class that you'd like to expand on in an interactive project, we encourage you to return to stories you know well.</p>

        <h4>Plagiarism and Copyright</h4>
        <p>It is a serious ethical violation to take any material created by another person and represent it as your own original work. Any such plagiarism will result in serious disciplinary action, possibly including dismissal from the CUNY J-School. Plagiarism may involve copying text from a book or magazine without attributing the source, or lifting words, code, photographs, videos, or other materials from the Internet and attempting to pass them off as your own. Please ask the instructor if you have any questions about how to distinguish between acceptable research and plagiarism.</p>
        <p>In addition to being a serious academic issue, copyright is a serious legal issue.</p>
        <p>Never "lift" or "borrow" or "appropriate" or "repurpose" graphics, audio, or code without both permission and attribution. This guidance applies to scripts, audio, video clips, programs, photos, drawings, and other images, and it includes images found online and in books.</p>
        <p>Create your own graphics, seek out images that are in the public domain or shared via a creative commons license that allows derivative works, or use images from the AP Photo Bank or which the school has obtained licensing.</p>
        <p>If you’re repurposing code, be sure to keep the original licensing intact. If you’re not sure how to credit code, ask.</p>
        <p>The exception to this rule is fair use: if your story is about the image itself, it is often acceptable to reproduce the image. If you want to better understand fair use, the Citizen Media Law Project is an excellent resource.</p>
        <p>When in doubt: ask.</p>

        <h4>Syllabus Changes</h4>
        <p>I'll be evaluating the pace of the class as we go, so this syllabus will be constantly updated and changed.</p>

        <p>Feel free to <a href="mailto:sisi.wei@journalism.cuny.edu">e-mail me</a> anytime with questions you have about assignments, your progress, or if you're just lost and need help. I'll my best to respond quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>Office Hours</strong> will be by appointment only, however I'm happy to stick around after class ends to help anyone who needs it. Since I work for ProPublica during the day, it'll be hard for me to get to CUNY in-person outside of class. However, I'm more than happy to setup Skype or Google Hangout appointments.</p>
